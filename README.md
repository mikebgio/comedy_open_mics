## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd comedy-open-mic-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install
# or manually:
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost/comedy_db"
export SESSION_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

4. Initialize the database:

```

5. Seed with test data (optional):
```bash
make seed
```

6. Run the application:
```bash
make run
# or
python main.py
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests only
make test-integration

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

### Test Structure

- `test_app.py` - Unit tests for core functionality
- `tests/test_integration.py` - Integration tests for complete workflows
- `pytest.ini` - pytest configuration

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

### Pipeline Features
- **Automated Testing**: Runs unit and integration tests
- **Code Quality**: Linting with flake8, formatting with black
- **Security Scanning**: bandit and safety checks
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage analysis
- **Build Artifacts**: Creates deployment-ready packages

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
- Runs on push to main/develop branches
- Parallel jobs for testing, linting, and building

### Local Development Commands

```bash
# Development helpers
make help           # Show all available commands
make format         # Format code with black and isort
make lint          # Run code linting
make security      # Run security scans
make clean         # Clean temporary files
make db-reset      # Reset and reseed database
```

## Database Schema

### Tables
- **users**: User accounts (comedians/hosts)
- **events**: Open mic events
- **signups**: Comedian event registrations
- **event_cancellations**: Cancelled event dates

### Key Relationships
- Users can be both comedians and hosts
- Events belong to host users
- Signups link comedians to specific event dates
- Cancellations override normal event schedules
